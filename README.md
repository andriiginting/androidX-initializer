# androidX-initializer
I am one of the **lazy programmer**, so I made this script to init AndroidX repository to my local machine in just one step.

## How to run
After clone this project, run this command:

```
./androidx-init.sh
```

if the script don't have permission as executable, run this command:

```
chmod +x androidx-init
```

It will take a while to download AOSP and setup to your local machine. So take your coffee! :coffee:

Go check the [repository](https://github.com/androidx/androidx) for any futher information
